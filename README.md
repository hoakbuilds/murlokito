### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Former comp sci student & legacy worker bee.

I'm mostly active within the Solana developer community, currently maintaining the following projects:
- [Solnet](https://github.com/bmresearch/Solnet), the .NET SDK for [Solana](https://solana.com/).
- [Solnet.Serum](https://github.com/bmresearch/Solnet.Serum), a .NET integration library for [Project Serum](https://www.projectserum.com/)
- [Solnet.Mango](https://github.com/bmresearch/Solnet.Mango), a .NET integration library for [Mango Markets](https://www.mango.markets/)
- [Solnet.Pyth](https://github.com/bmresearch/Solnet.Pyth), a .NET integration library for [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/)

and last but not least, focused on shipping the most kickass web3 experiences with [Project Citadel](https://devpost.com/software/project-citadel), which won the Web3 Track at the Solana Ignition Hackathon.

The easiest way to find me talking about non-tech stuff is probably at [@hoaktrades](https://twitter.com/hoaktrades).
